
Project: Temperature PWM Fan Control
====================================

Purpose:
------------------------------------

The goal of the project is to create a software and hardware to control standard 4-wire fans based on temperature sensors.

Basic features:
------------------------------------

* microcontroller with pwm outout for three fans
* multiple temperature sensors via I2C
* rtc via i2c
* serial interface for debugging and configuration
